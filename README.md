## About the Project

Expense App is a **simple web application** for managing personal finances. It allows users to easily add and delete financial expenses, as well as analyze their expenses and income (in the form of the table so far).

I'll rewrite it on Next.js for more practice soon...

<h3>The app is built using the following technologies:</h3>
- **React**
- **Zustand**
- **Firebase**
